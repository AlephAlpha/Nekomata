# Nekomata

Trying to make a small [non-deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_programming) [concatenative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language) [golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) language.

I still don't know how to achieve nondeterminism. I'm trying to follow the paper [*KiCS2: A New Compiler from Curry to Haskell*](https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/WFLP11_KiCS2.pdf), but I still don't understand some details of the paper.

## Name

[***Nekomata***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekomata) (猫又) are a kind of cat monster in Japanese folklore that have forked tails. I think it's a good name for a con**cat**enative language that chooses between forking paths of computation.
